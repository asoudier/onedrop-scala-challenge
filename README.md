# onedrop-scala-challenge

I built this project with the play framework (https://www.playframework.com/) and scala. I made the choice to use the open weather api geo locations endpoint to ge the lat and lon of a city or zip and that pass that through to the different endpoints. I realized later that each endpoint could take a city or zip but just kept it that way for thoroughness. I used scalaj (https://github.com/scalaj/scalaj-http) for the http requests it seemed like a good library that simplified some of the work. For the unit tests I didn't have a great sense of what the best tests would be but tried to keep it simple and attempted to match the basic template play provided. One issue I ran into was finding an endpoint for the 'Given a city/zip and a date range, provide an API that computes average, min and max temperatures for that city. This is separate from the current weather and 7-day forecast APIâ€™s' problem. There didn't seem to be a free one available that supported this functionality. Instead I used the history/city endpoint and passed in a single date to get something similar that would show that I could make an endpoint that was able to handle date parameters.
